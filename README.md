&nbsp;&nbsp;InGen Reimbusment Portal</h1>

We have created a way for InGen for employees to be able to request reimbusments for things such as traveling from the home office in Palo Alto to the office in Isla Sorna or if a InGen scientist was to find some fossialized Dinosaur DNA in their back yard that would be a good addtion to the companies collection. Managers will then be able to approve and deny the request.
